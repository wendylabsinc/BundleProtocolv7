# BundleProtocolv7

Welcome to the official BundleProtocolv7 repository under the Wendylabsinc organization! This package aims to provide a reliable bundle management and exchange protocol. Learn more about the Bundle Protocol v7 here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9171

Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is a network architecture designed to handle environments where connections are intermittent, disrupted, or have significant delays. Unlike traditional internet protocols, which require continuous and immediate connections, DTN operates using a store-and-forward approach. Data is stored at each node until a connection becomes available to forward it further. This allows communication to continue even when the network is fragmented or unreliable.

The Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) is a key protocol for DTN. It divides data into self-contained units called bundles. Each bundle includes all the necessary metadata for delivery, such as the destination address and any instructions for handling delays. These bundles can be stored by intermediate nodes until the next link in the network is ready, ensuring that data eventually reaches its destination.

DTN and BPv7 are used in scenarios where traditional networking fails. In space exploration, they enable communication between spacecraft and Earth despite long delays and limited connectivity. On Earth, they connect remote regions where infrastructure is unavailable and support disaster recovery efforts when regular networks are damaged.

The basic process involves creating a bundle of data at the source, storing it at the first node if no immediate connection is available, and forwarding it when the next node becomes reachable. This process repeats until the bundle reaches its destination, maintaining the integrity of the data throughout the journey.

## Features

- Efficient bundling of resources
- Simple, extensible design for handling bundles
- Focused on reliability and performance

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wendylabsinc/BundleProtocolv7.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd BundleProtocolv7
   ```
3. Use your favorite package manager or tooling to install dependencies (if applicable).

## Usage

After installing, you can import this package into your project and begin working with the bundle management functionalities it provides. Make sure to reference the code examples in the source for further usage details.

## Generating Documentation with DocC

If this is a Swift package, you can generate DocC documentation with the Swift toolchain:

1. Make sure you have Xcode 13+ installed or a Swift toolchain that supports DocC.
2. From the command line, navigate to your package directory:
   ```bash
   cd BundleProtocolv7
   ```
3. Run the following command to generate and preview the documentation:
   ```bash
   swift package --allow-writing-to-directory ./docs \
   generate-documentation --output-path ./docs --product BundleProtocolv7
   ```
4. (Optional) You can use the following command to serve and view the documentation locally:
   ```bash
   swift package --disable-sandbox preview-documentation --product BundleProtocolv7
   ```
   This should open a window in your default browser, allowing you to browse the generated docs.

We plan to keep the documentation up to date as the package evolves, so be sure to check back for new guides and references.
